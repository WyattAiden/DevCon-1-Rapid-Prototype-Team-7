### Prototyped Mechanic

We will be prototyping a game mechanic, in which a player can smoothly transition between a 2d platformer's perspective and a top-down perspective at the press of a button.

### Objective Statement:

Our purpose for creating this prototype is to see if this mechanic can be performed without causing a player to feel confused or disoriented.

### Design Rationale

This will be highly puzzle based as the primary mechanic is not fit for action, giving the player the ability to change a platformer into a top down rpg will allow us to come up with some creative puzzles that involve looking at interacting with the world with different perspectives.

### Week 1:

It was entirely ideation and we were mostly just throwing ideas at the wall to see what stuck

- Ball Catching Platformer.

- the player jumps between moving platforms.

- balls fall from the top of the screen.

- catching balls increases player score.

- the playerâ€™s goal is to attain the highest score possible.

- the game ends when the player misses 5 balls or falls between platforms.

- Arena shooter

- A platform fighting game that would have an emphasis on using ranged attacks

- Block breaker

- Rhythm game

- Fighting game

- posture meter/stamina management

- Puzzle platformer

- Using recall/savestate mechanics

- Puzzle platformer

- switches into top-down rpg

### Week 2:

After handling several github issues we finally got started with the actuation of the prototype

### Week 3:

We have finished a functional prototype with examples shown below
