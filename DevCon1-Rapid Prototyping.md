## Basic Prototype Information

### Prototyped Mechanic
We will be prototyping a game mechanic, in which a player can smoothly transition between a 2d platformer's perspective and a top-down perspective.

### Objective Statement
Our purpose for creating this prototype is to see if this mechanic can be performed without causing a player to feel confused or disoriented.

### Design Rationale
We believe that this mechanic could be used in a full game as a base ability for traversal and puzzle solving. 

The Platformer Perspective allows the player to travers locations of varying heights by jumping, as well as pass areas that are too narrow for the player in the Top-Down Perspective.

The Top-Down Perspective allows the player to traverse to locations that appear to be in the background and foreground of the Platformer Perspective. This perspective can also be used to show players the bottoms of pits and possible new paths, which are unobservable from the Platformer Perspective.
